An A or A-. I reasearched a lot in order to find out what some of my errors were.

I couldn't get it to display right-to-left. Probably a B on that front.

4. Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
I didn't realize until after I submited it that I wasn't displaying right-to-left, so I didn't come up with any solutions. That and understanding error codes were definately where I struggled.
